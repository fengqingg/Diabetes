# Diabetes Classification with R
This repository contains an R notebook (Diabetes_Classification.ipynb) that performs classification of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The notebook utilizes machine learning algorithms to train a model to predict whether or not a person has diabetes based on certain medical predictor variables.

# Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need to have R and the following packages installed:

dplyr
ggplot2
tidyr
caret
You can install these packages by running the following command in R:

'''
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "caret"))
'''

# Usage
To use the notebook, you can simply open it in Jupyter and run each cell sequentially. The notebook is divided into several sections:

Introduction
Data Exploration
Data Cleaning and Preparation
Model Building and Training
Model Evaluation
The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step, as well as code snippets and visualizations to help you understand the process.

# Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset contains information on female patients at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage who live near Phoenix, Arizona. The dataset includes 768 instances with 8 medical predictor variables and 1 binary target variable (whether or not the patient has diabetes).
