# Machine learning classifier using R
This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and it originated from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. There are 768 observations with 8 medical predictor variables and 1 target variable.
